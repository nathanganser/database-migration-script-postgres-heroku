# Database Migration Script Postgres Heroku
A simple script you can run to copy your database from one URI to another.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## How to use
1. Deploy on Heroku (use the button above)
2. Enter the URI for your existing (source) and new (destination) database URIs
3. Once the app is deployed, click on "Manage app" and check the logs.

The script will run until the migration is complete and shut down.

## Why?
Database migrations are such a pain... I lost countless hours, hopefully this will save you a few :)
